# the-structure

## Desscription
The structure is a third person 2d survival game with a map that randomly generates each game you play. The point of the game is to solve all the puzzles and the mystery of the structure while having to survive the dangerous world in which the game takes place. The structure will be generating different biomes over a certain number of levels (different maps from which the player can move to and from), all made of different sets of tiles. 

## Biomes

- **Residential Areas:** Residential areas have two states (maybe), inhabited and abandoned (mostly just abandoned). The inhabited ones will have npcs going around with their day and the abandoned ones will be only occupied by hostels and neutral mobs. Both have loot but the inhabitants are gonna get mad if you take their things (neutral mobs). 
- **Industries:** Industries will have two states as well (abandoned and inhabited). They have the same characteristics as the residential areas but have different loot and design. More open space and the possibility to use machines (maybe). 
- **Voids:** voids are going to be huge open spaces with only narrow walkable terrain. If the player goes over the edge, the player falls and dies.  Not much loot but hostile mobs that drops unique loot. Voids will be generated mostly in the mid levels.
- **Entertainment districts:** Entertainment districts will have the same characteristics as the residential areas and the industries but with different loot and style. They will mainly have a central area surrounded with big hallways and different smaller shop type areas.
- **Slums:** The slums will be heavily inhabited by neutral and hostile mobs. They will look a lot like a mix between residential, industries and entertainment districts but with a lot of decay. They will be mostly generated in lower levels.
- **Gated Districts:** Gated Districts will be inhabited by hostile mobs guarding the territories. The loot in the gated districts will be very rare and this is where the player will gain access to the end of the game. They will only be generated in the top levels.
